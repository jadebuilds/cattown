    "\n",
    "If there were major speed advantages to using this over a frame-by-frame background subtracting motion detector and state memory, we might consider an optimization where we do motion detection to look for new objects, then hand them over to the tracker.  Maybe this could run on some limited ROI border around the cat board.  However, this wouldn't pick up cats leaping in from the direction of the camera and bypassing the outer border.  The inability of this tracker to report failure is also troubling... we would have to run some other check if the tracked object was near the border and not moving for a while to make sure it was still there.\n",
